# TEE_MAPSE

Project thesis at Cybernetics and Robotics at NTNU, in collaboration with The Operating Room of the Future (FOR) at St. Olavs. The thesis is a continuitation of the corresponding project on 2D data, with Trym Nordal as initial developer.

Project description provided by Kiss:

"Our assumption is that functional monitoring of the heart under surgery can be performed automatically based on TEE ultrasound. Typically, before  cardiac interventions a trans esophageal (TEE) probe is placed by an experienced echocardiographer in a mid- or high-esophageal position. The resulting  TEE volumes allow for a very good visualization of the basal parts of the left ventricle, therefore it should be feasible to compute both global and regional  parameters and follow their change as the intervention progresses.

To characterize the function of the heart, we have chosen to focus on MAPSE (mitral annular plane systolic excursion), peak systolic and peak early  diastolic velocity as well as strain based on TEE images to characterize ventricle function. MAPSE is a robust and easy to derive functional parameter  that correlates well with global left ventricular function. Deep learning has been shown to be a feasible approach to automatically derive MAPSE values as  well as strain values an 2D images.

Aims:

The aim of the project is to investigate the applicability of such methods on 3D data.

Tasks:

1. Develop 3D anatomic landmark tracking algorithms based on deep learning

2. Evaluate the accuracy of the developed method and compare against state of the art"
